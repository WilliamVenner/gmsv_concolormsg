# ðŸŒˆ gmsv_concolormsg

This module for Garry's Mod fixes x86-64 Windows 64-bit SRCDS not displaying colours.

Why does it do that? Who knows! But it's easily fixable.

I hope this will improve your local development experience.

# Installation

1. Download the module from the releases section

2. Add `gmsv_concolormsg.vdf` to your addons folder.

3. Add `gmsv_concolormsg_win64.dll` to your lua/bin/ folder. If bin doesn't exist, create it.
